## Introduction

After long discussion on ideas of issues currently facing our world, four members of UCFs coding bootcamp decided that it would be best to create a flight app that allows users, in a very simple way, access to data that may make or break their travel plans. We all know how tough it can be to travel in today's current state whether it be an unexpected storm or not knowing which gate to go to. That's why we came up with Travel Buddy. An all-in-one application that allows you, the traveler, access to all the information you need to make it to your final destination. We want traveling to be a fun experience so come join us at Travel Buddy.

## Roadmap

    Our goal for future updates is to integrate Googles Map platform to allow users to find locations near them to plan events and outings so that they can make the most of each trip planned. We would like users to have a stress free vacation and family members to know what recommendations they can give to their loved ones or friends.
